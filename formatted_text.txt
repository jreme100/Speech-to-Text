1: hi Georgina 

0: yes this is she working on this is John remember her I'm calling about at the interview we're gonna have a progressive activism yeah the card is fine fine how bout yourself I will retire yeah I was like well there's an open spot on Monday morning but you're out of old and I was like well it's got to be that again sh yeah no well first off I just want to stay thank you for taking the time and I really appreciate it I usually start off by giving a little background on my project and kind of how it can be you know what I hope it will become and then you know if you have any questions about it ask me and then I have another theory the 

1: my structured interview question so we have an idea of what I want to know but sometime in the conversation that are never really interesting and we end up like candied pecans and stuff like that so so yeah and that's fine if you can give any questions for me then you know we can we can do that well 

0: okay so basically the product for me I'm at intermission in on that it added at the university of Pennsylvania are you from handling it well you know if you're able yeah I lived in Philly right a little bit of a year my sophomore year of high school okay I lived in Westchester okay yeah my fiance is from when I was like telling him there really close yeah yeah I just I was only there for a year background I'm going to come from sure yeah so anyway I was there doing 58 in 

1: Asian and before that I had worked for after the union and or outranking second campaign and I kind of also yeah I was really fun it is it is really sad how it all turned out I think he did something not done much a lot of it that but but regardless so I was doing that and I went back and I was planning on it but he liked the technologies that people use like organized campaigns which I have are you working and you know not to do it and then I went to 2015 I DNT convention put everything else together the 1 how you got nominated and I ended up interviewing a lot of that California delegation which leads to standardize with very noisy and there was a lot of I don't know a lot of public local lot of really interesting and activism going on there which kind of made me interested in you know California Democrat party general so then I started going to you know like the state convention in California and doing project there and that kind of grew into a like a larger dissertation for me which the broader question is basically like how do progressive activists organized for what they want within the Democratic Party with like California and educate I've been interviewing engineering highlight delegates like yourself like interviewing people who are work with indivisible that are like and RT or interviewing people that he himself has a little more outside the park and last but want the party to change it I think all that kind of how those groups in Iraq and particularly in an online but not exclusively to you know online the overall don't overlap between life online organizing and like what they are W. campaigns or or other such thing and so so that my project and then in the end I was able to produce the dissertation but nobody really read anybody taking in the real world so I I opened up to produce you know some kind of report it will be more useful for people like yourself you know about like what the you know exactly the practice where and what people do you think that and and and best practice across the state that might be useful in California and maybe like burning progressive caucuses and whatnot in in other states as well those are kind of my your questions for me 

0: no 

1: okay thank you doctor started my my prescriptions always just tell me a little bit about your background and and how you got involved in how long you've been involved in in activism and and then and then only after the broadly when that became kind of party activists 

0: so I removed born in my family and for sure not cemex raise it before and first person and I think we were outside of the house financial I live there cheers 65 right background up until about 

1: 13 for half of my 

0: it's great lows for my freshman year of high school building in Iran the stock for a year my mom one job and alright so that's right I also did my junior and senior years of high school Moran and I have done my first year college here at UC Santa Cruz on my second year yeah it's almost here so that's where I'm at right now I started getting into this kind of stuff basically when I moved to Monterrey I was just driving to school like first day and I saw you are you familiar with local listings California Senate ocean not super I mean I'm I'm from I'm from the East Bay so like I get you know the way you hear about it help on a politician and stuff and I've heard a lot of things through this project right but if you give me a little primer I would understand it a little more yeah yes if you're familiar with the internal yeah thank you from all right so the shrine Iran or Congress in 2016 which is the same summer that I missed all right and so I was just you know I driving around town started campaign offers and I was like 0 well actually she did a little bit of a problem but my mom you've been extremely interested in politics minds are growing and the obvious yeah I had no opportunity to get a call back Iran says United able to participate in the process I can't tell I understand these kinds are likely to cause you're volunteering with 10.balls here they should let you expresso internship once he got into office a couple months later and so I can search it for about 10 months we I'm also working on a organized like actual human national walk out day after parkland I yeah I organized my high school and like the whole school changes records sent out looks like it really takes from Union City getting a moderate area like activism and politics and then I also started working on a couple of local campaign after dark I'm sure the summer before I moved to Santa Cruz I was working on L. local arm should be council campaign Lorraine and mayoral campaign beginning brings my arm and said I'm all doing a little bit of a stamp collector campaign then like stuff for the Democratic Party we now offer custom stuff so I was looking at getting back I became an AGM delegates first year but they haven't increased and also as you bring Boston like student government here in I'm currently the legislative director our campus education reciprocate you see why you have amassed I guess work really closely with the governor and light numbers actually cover last week which is super cool in my last year my freshman year the person who was in my position the stock was accomplished and singing with let's say a lot about like higher education students asking are you asking them to give you some more funding certain numbers right you see things like that I bought it last year 

1: that's great I mean that I would use it in your head right it doesn't 3 and I look at a graph of what the cop that changed and then just not thank 

0: it's resource yeah 

1: so why not a lot of people not a lot of people who were the first year in college run for 8:00 AM how did you come to how did you come to like know about that and want to do it and an organized around it and whatnot 

0: yes when I was working for conversion campaign 

1: first 

0: thank she'll injure person person in charge mostly what I'm amazing I really showed me like he's the one who got me interested you know like he really is only showing the roast you just really want selectmen for young people to help them get involved as much as possible because the system can become starting both the third people seller answer all kinds of people who don't play access all the resources everyone knows and so it's hard to really push it to you know get involved the parties must make certain I heard about I get emails from the party pretty sure I got an email about the camera features and there's no obligation and is running a couple of the people on the international the people that I was working for over the summer I was on my way and then at a city councillor now they're on the way I knew a couple of people to Thailand you need to finance a a comfortable situation for me 

1: yeah I can do that for you Mobileye the kind of work that not just the 3 lines of well yeah I connected with some some people are so happy that they all showed up which is really cool I yes I will get to mention Bernie in Wisconsin and hope that you get a lot 

0: our well yeah exactly 

1: yeah I'm hoping that and then I felt that I can I can the other should be different thank so so you said you wanna wait how did that come to be 

0: when I arrived here he was born yeah the machine what is it that you're like oh I know the person running late for example one and so it was kind of like you know Slater by chance yeah I think I can pretty easily and I checked it was resolved our currently crisply some are you ready my question that when you have a party I look at how it and they're getting up and down your in terms of your relationship with the Democratic Party doesn't have to be with your local but like you're feeling conflict or operations or anything like that yeah you know I mean I'm going to Persian is always a focal supporting like institution in the U. S. army builder hi we are in Plano I get a lot of blocks from my peers and my family members or even eating whatever credit card you get what you should be N. G. P. you know they are thank you transaction how part is always a little bit conflicting yeah sure I'd love it if I could just you know so I don't shipper you know Progressive Party are by thank you we all know are you a member of the third place I'm gonna try you know I I see as far as local medical but I think the biggest problem down another aspect of it is of course right I've noticed that the state already I feel it doesn't do a lot for young people who are down here right for example to go straight to our convention and temperatures fell in June I heart you you know ask around people right anyone would be willing to give me some time without because I I for myself because you need to keep going on the trip you know I can go to the convention in Long Beach really far from here yeah also right out yeah have you seen any like more outside our university like 

1: go find me or like any way that people kind of organized getting them out there beyond just having their own money like a local or regional level or anything 

0: yeah no I definitely think people deal with fundraisers for straight people and the place you are generous enough to give any action which is really nice but I just wish that there was more flight support system like if you're gonna allow people like 18 to 22 a college student right I feel like you should think about okay these are college students all like the ninja strange I think creating some sort of scholarship or need based financial aid or something like that what is just and right now you know yeah pretty much 

1: would you say would you include yourself and those who are Hey they're trying to push the party to the left 

0: absolutely and and and if so why how what what we have to go back trying to do that I'm not I think our right I mean I think that's it I was trying to push for more protesters chanted feel like that's a really big step you know making a request for a lot I I try to push for a line I think that'll probably not looking at things one dimensionally and they're giving like another perspective okay okay this is a great idea your sounds and make it better here so we can make it work and here so we can make progress and so that is something and be a long term you know issue area we can trying more you know you have to try and check his answers trying make it in with the issues options going on right now thank you copyright one of the biggest problems necessarily have to go on it like you know to the left but that people are just not seeing this future I have them right the repercussions that way transaction logs and like the kind of looking at the right now we have the support on the issue that we have right now you're not looking at like okay what Bob back and be great but you know what you can long term plans ain't there must last forever you know and so that's something that I kind of wonderful coming up last year like student government our solution or 

1: so you like the look here's a great idea you're cleaning our records anymore can you give me an example of one that you think you can think of them if that idea 

0: for example something that's been on my mind lately there you go in the California state legislature about regulating tobacco to make sleep cycle leverage you know smoking products and stuff and well sure you know if you look at your like craziness looking bad share more restrictions 5 and then you read the bill and you either includes restrictions for culture a cultural looking out it's like and like other things that like if you download will be detrimental to communities and California still practice does as part of their culture so that's just one example 

1: yeah so what is really being involved in the Democratic Party what do you get your your rolling and what are your goal 

0: I think I I personally think my goal of getting young people involved as much as possible you know especially in moderate where a lot of people go to retire you don't young people in general repair let alone participating in the party so I really try to get my friend as in Paul just possible you know I was in charge of voter registration for Murray county Democratic Party for a little bit and I really was just every college almost every day in Monterey trying to get the full research for possible I feel like that's something that I have a lot of hockey for most of the share of chanting refugees each institution so I am super passionate about that HM the king selections are right after lunch that is really good she also no longer stand it's making sure that people kind of know who their representatives are right okay you're angry about this issue which is looking because a lot of young people have like this past year anger in that often either like misdirected or kind of just like left by yeah okay here's what you can do that 

1: that's great 

0: what challenges you you base your frustration you run into is trying to keep those right how did you run into when trying to achieve those goals are you know some people don't believe in these institutions for the right reason but I actually you know just excited so that's you know kind of something that I have to keep into consideration is that not all communities are going to appreciate me coming in there and telling them to participate in a track or because they're like this is a lobbying trip with near all that kind of stuff because these institutions have failed so spectacularly correctly why should they have anything you know okay you're going to because my life I'm going to be great for me you know you don't really need the instructions ever directly getting numbers how will we screwed over in the power something you know very well actually get the community involved you know we have one day yes Sir not lying to me about 

1: yeah 8 people who like high disillusioned with what are you talking to try to get them all 

0: yeah all right all right you're right and my age you know this is how you will benefit your directly unlike others thank at work I feel sorry sure sure 

1: are you a member of the correct part and the delegates 

0: I don't think so but I think I'm 

1: yeah you and 

0: number yeah I'm I'm not one bit yeah I know I'm talking about like when you go to like characters or something and they have all the cards beating are you hate getting to participate in some ways of helping a member your your bank or credit card at the yeah I've been a bunch I have told you if you copy is that you come next time thanks for talking 

1: and you have an opinion about the progress of okay if you like what you hear this role within like you know this is thank the biggest one this is giant group of 8:00 AM thank you if you have any other kind of let it roll it in California politics for the company directory are you 

0: another important question are you a little bit more are you but I don't really need that right you out side of what people within the party well if you're in the party I'm sure you can see all the great work that they're doing everything that you are when it comes and try to get right right outside that we don't well it's not much because 

1: well in your opinion what if anything needs to change about and you have an idea in your mind of like what the ideal relationship RT and it and it didn't look like 

0: I'm sorry Sir yeah I think how are she right first general Mormon Myra all you know having them fill out one of the few convention now all of our 

1: you know 

0: yeah all right anything having 

1: having a little trouble understanding you I think the name change and if you move away from the phone or something yeah yeah 

0: elite yeah I'm sorry I also want people how are you statewide level because they have an optional level I don't know if you have the big thing that I can prevent people from wanting to participate I thought about 

1: but yeah are you part of community activists on line in the younger party activism 

0: really I I try to not use social media to much I used Twitter to keep up with like my dad like what's going on back there because you could use and I said how much is your service yeah right back social media time but I do keep up with great are you going right you know I read 

1: sure so he jumping a little bit away from and and you just a little bit more how much water but I'll ask it anyway where do you primarily get your political information you regularly listen to or watch any political podcasts online program 

0: yeah I love cricket yeah and you know how although there are right okay the world aren't solely focused on American politics I watched him and all the time because each company or at our assembly yeah I I watch you yes a lot but very much like 

1: thank you I think what I can get 

0: and I also yeah I read a lot of online newspapers yes hi they are currently on the box  yeah right yeah 

1: thank you do you ever relay that information to like your friends are accurate other people anyway all my friends and I are 

0: because I am constantly about politics and everything 

1: she also sells only how 

0: whatever we think we always and if you have a group chat we can the other night we're all watching them acknowledge that it right under coverage yeah all right people to do he could not 

1: I haven't I I think I saw a couple of the first 

0: the first one I don't know what he's doing on my part but I would like what more when you yeah grammar yeah we also 

1: when you're in a group chat are you what did you get your Facebook messenger or what happened or what what what makes 

0: yeah right we 

1: well 

0: yeah what will actually look we should the combat 

1: when did you when you were writing I'll get you need to use if you are from yet all are your kind of rounding up people on both for you or or anything like that your slate well no not really I 

0: on my first call for a match I didn't know it was all about where is what really only aware of how we're order a lot of we'll see well hello there yeah I am actually out of town or well I imagine researchers are there will 

1:  

0: you know I mean in the parking lot of the people like any Tyler 

1: we have met yeah you're at an ATM other programs don't get back with them at all you're not at at the 

0: what I'm asking you interacted all other progressive delegate that you've met either online or in person all the people who are on the where people are how do you how I talking all the time I'm coming yeah E. R. I haven't seen our topic shower Jefferies network SmartMoney organizer here exactly okay for 

1:  you writer for any any material about politics how did he do for class right like a blog or social media or YouTube or you already live at the end 

0: okay or actually 

1: can you tell me a little bit about that even after that we write about like that 

0: right I don't want your correct your or if you have a lobby or director who's the person who runs our lobby questioning yeah students in Holland while the rest because we also we hear all the for local yeah okay all 

1: you are here 

0: last week was the reason that you okay 

1: she got a double check 

0: hello yeah where are you 8 got all that 

1: interesting every time I hear that that man you don't act like someone who is a college student but every time I hear that at 13 it just like propaganda regional in the 19 seventies like that's like a being the people that corrected the cap he added no we are debating and another thing to begin with generation of for sure so so beyond the the stuff you are talking about are you you have relationships with like other activist organizations like indivisible or our revolution or California correct alignment act 

0: John reporting item why am I personally I wish I had all right well I really don't have a lot okay more are you are you are you know people there are I stand you you know a lot of right our people are hi he what 

1: a couple life all right national hearing her great what we're gonna 

0: ask me there are yeah I used to work for them yeah 

1: yeah 

0: I worked 

1: yeah so going back to retirement at a convention a little earlier on I know you weren't able to and one in Long Beach when you put and it other one what are your kind of hold while you're there 

0: I'm is to learn as much about the people that were possible you know not a lot of people get the opportunity to lay speaker campaign represented a small campaign so back in June when we have really early what you want to talk about personally you know I might hear from what they are exactly not like one year time yeah yeah I was pretty cool also if you know you I was really shocked the convention in Long Beach because I really want involved voting for the state party chair in June it was really exciting 3:00 hours but lots of people here and it is an exciting time use this opportunity that was not a 100 people have yeah R. Michael Warren also charging me to call myself yeah you know young Democrats out there saying they have like the cost 

1: you can talk with your people well totally you were you involved in any organizing even just that they aren't around candidates or party chair right 

0: I am fortunate each 

1: yeah but I would like yeah do you feel like a progressive idea opinions about I had a great grand or how turned out or anything like that 

0: we can only done a lot more mature champagne and like you know kind of push a little bit more I'm not saying that you transaction date or anything I did she did a great rest but she dumped maybe but like I feel like maybe there was a lot more today he says our hearts you heart like me because the tenant resources proper I feel like she could definitely reach out to young people more you know I used to that it was it was pretty weird ones like the course in the amount of mail and gas from last year thank you for hard wired what and you also just call me like remotely and you know just making sure you're still not the that was really late she's not even out between you and my eyes I only got like one or 2 fires from somebody's personal last year there were definitely looks pretty big disparity in their campaign campaigns by arm thank you yeah the resource and for 

1: so in that case more questions if they are within like the different networks hearing whether that are you know workers don't overlap between your network at your student government at India today the people in jackfruit kind of disagreement around like action or activism that within those groups and if so how does that play out 

0: yeah I mean I'm sure you any space there is going to be registered after that you go well let's answer as you and you have to beat yesterday which is our student on campus so bars he it is the largest heating government of any use every every chemical agent yeah right you know yes yes yes yes right you have a lot like 10 to 15 batters arm and the Russian government and that's a really really great system that works I gotta sorcery UC Santa Cruz uses a custom that allows over 50 people to be voting members of their student government and frankly one of the biggest stars in the receipt and this year's running great right we have an amazing part of the story and the people that officers were like you know the president and the vice president of external affairs that works for all of the people are doing a great job but when you're voting by 50 people and you're trying to beat our student government that is actually functioning actually can cooperate with each other you know killing is extremely hard to do that not only was just with a few people but with a few people who don't always know what they're doing because they don't open 

1: you only 

0: and so because like other campuses you have to run for office you have to meet certain criteria right you have to know a certain amount about the city government do you wait right you're not gonna win if your option or if you don't know it's not look at you know what you're doing because we don't have Alexion blacked out really here for our student government representatives thank you senator we have people who desperately want to oversee and manage the point also our campus generally have a pretty negative you are should have left because of wonder you know funding and all that kind of stuff yeah and just general untrusted marketing which to send armed because of that you already have people you know about it you don't want 

1: okay 

0: well I have or mechanical in question is when you planned actions whether they're like are you know trips the thing or wow okay or whatever and how how do you recruit people to participate thank arm what kind of action is usually quiet on media outrage I don't really do social media 19 of pretty good at it I have my lobby for direct your usually deal out which selects a group of you especially since you see them which is where a lot of students what he says he like credit pages were a lot of students blocked I'm making a lot of rain firing firing works if it doesn't actively if you do it you have a useless instead on campus because it's so huge so we have some of the best off on them so that is definitely a factor that is useful sometimes you have an email list we're efficient enough to get out of the home 

1: and I set up my laptop and use that so you use it as a UCSD credit and that that's popular 

0: yeah I look at 

1: can you tell me about that like what I've never heard about that for many people like I heard a lot of okay 

0: I mean I don't really have many organizing actions on their first it depends you know if it's something that I feel like a wide group of students organization and I will close on their if not then if I think the only people that can I think you're right the circle will do it from my end something that is a not for sending emails with politics department and legal studies department advisory email black everyone nature's nature's Cooper's unique for you you can see the problem thank you yes I need you to show up for right action but if it's something like voter registration or like a really cool campus I did that then I will I would definitely encourage people do a lot of outreach on there for getting people like consider stop hi this is I guess people are a little bit more money because people are here already and they aren't as users of the other like a little bit more right like every sense 

1: shovel I would close with your question first is there anything we we've we've got about trying to talk about it and the kind of the general stuff I'm interested in anything that I haven't asked about or like an example of an interesting or or whatnot that right do you think is relevant I just had to come up in the course of my question 

0: I think I'm gonna keep talking no I think you you walk into your yard I love the work that I've done alright I hope you're not getting a connection but I have been wondering kind of go over into Santa Cruz and I don't have to make brand new ones right right but I'm also I'm really proud of the work that you are manageable we get a lot done right a lot of barriers and plus something that I like 

1: sh I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to you I have a market there anyone else do you think I should talk to them you can be 

0: and yeah we see if I can connect you with Dave on Harvard is R. as jury president he is he ready he's been involved in the hardy shall come on very strong he got a lot of work and she never met here in Santa Cruz also one of my local affairs one name that they have the president Avon Avon G. A. B. and then 

1: and where is it coming out 

0: yeah one of my local affairs actually particularly involved in my personal line like yesterday and these kinds of groups and he also works with right I'm on the floor I'm almost certain that tribal band indigenous groups I think you work for propaganda thing right 18 I'm at the office thank you for 

1: you are transfer students into college this person here yesterday and he also checked your cool I would really appreciate that that would be wonderful sometimes I can get a cold email from the delegates but sometimes it's just great to get find out you know people aren't in that exact unity but are really active greatly to get connected with a 

0: what great well if you don't have anything for me then I I just wanna say thank you again for taking the time to really helpful and then when I finish the project I will definitely double back with everybody at OCU just kind of like you know the result of this you know if you think you conversations and what overlap we have and you know what there is what the takeaway cartons I'd love to allow people to you know if there's an interesting strategic thinking they're all that stuff I love people be able to put that back into the progressive community yeah sounds great 

1: well then I hope you're you're cold I hope it doesn't turn out to be much of a bold and I hope you were reading a great rest of your extremely busy calendar week 

0: thank you so much I appreciate that all right thank you for speaking their Christian no problem I will I will I'll double back with you you know at the end of the year when I finish up on that and good luck with the rest of your work on the campaign the primary the fault is not with everything you're doing well thank you so much I'm gone if you
